# mrrp
my personal discord bot!! started as a silly little thing to meow back at you but i eventually added a few useful features:

``front`` - pings pluralkit api for front information on a user
``remind`` - reminds you of a specified message sometime in the future
``quote`` - pulls a random quote from the server, filtering by >1 ️‍🔥 react by default but can take ``unfiltered`` as a boolean option (and quote a ``user``)
``fire`` - creates a leaderboard for messages in the server based on number of  ️‍🔥  reacts

## install
this bot is written purely in nodejs (i'm so sorry), and only requires ``discord.js`` to be installed with ``npm install discord.js`` to work. other than that, check out the ``exampleconfig.json`` to fill in details with your own bot, rename it to ``config.json``, and away you go~
